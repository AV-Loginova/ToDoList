# ToDoList
This app was created to help me to become well versed in hooks, in particular useState hook. In the future I'm going to add new tabs with home chores, interactive calendar and work duties.

## 25.12.2023
For now APP has a tab with an ability to ad strings in the list. 
## 26.12.2023
Created gitignore file. After adding to the list text disappears from input. Checked todos now are crossed out. Add button is disabled if input is empty.
## 27.12.2023
Added function to delete existing todos. Modified the logic of adding todos, instead of adding data to a 'data' array, now data is written to a 'todos' array, which rewrites itself.
## 18.01.2023
Added registration/authorization function. Were used: express, mysql. 
Added the ability to edit quote in the profile. Quote is also added to db.
